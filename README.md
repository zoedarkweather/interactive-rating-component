### What I learned

I'd just completed several relevant sections of the MDN Frontend Developer Course - Advanced Form Styling, UI Pseudo Classes, and Client-side Validation, so this was an opportunity to practice some of the things I've learned. I used radio buttons for the rating options as that seemed to make the most sense and be the most accessable way to do it. I had difficulty styling them at first and then I realized I should style the labels instead. I'm not sure if this was the correct way to do it, so any feedback on those choices would be helpful.  

10/11 updates: Centered component on page, added aria-live attribute so "thank you" is read by screen reader. Radio buttons are currently not able to be checked using the keyboard.  

10/13 updates: Made radio buttons accessible by styling them directly rather than hiding them and styling their labels. Also made minor changes to html, removing unneccessary elements.

### Continued development

Continue practicing styling form elements.
