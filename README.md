## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I'd just completed several relevant sections of the MDN Frontend Developer Course - Advanced Form Styling, UI Pseudo Classes, and Client-side Validation, so this was an opportunity to practice some of the things I've learned. I used radio buttons for the rating options as that seemed to make the most sense and be the most accessable way to do it. I had difficulty styling them at first and then I realized I should style the labels instead. I'm not sure if this was the correct way to do it, so any feedback on those choices would be helpfuls.

### Continued development

Continue practicing styling form elements. 

### Useful resources

- [MDN - Advance Form Styling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Advanced_form_styling) - This chapter helped me learn how to remove default styling from form controls.
